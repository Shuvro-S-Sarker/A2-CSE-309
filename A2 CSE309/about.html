      <h1>About Valorant</h1>
      <p>
        Valorant is a team-based first-person tactical hero shooter set in the
        near future. Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on
        several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode,
        players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each
        team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each
        requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires
        charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Every player starts
        each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability"
        charges. Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an
        in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the
        previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any
        objectives completed. The game has an assortment of weapons including
        secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns,
        shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles. There are
        automatic and semi-automatic weapons that each have a unique shooting
        pattern that has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot
        accurately.[9] It currently offers 23 agents to choose from. They are
        Brimstone, Viper, Omen, Cypher, Sova, Sage, Phoenix, Jett, Raze, Breach,
        Reyna, Killjoy, Skye, Yoru, Astra, KAY/O, Chamber, Neon, Fade, Harbor,
        Gekko, Deadlock, and Iso. The player will get 5 unlocked agents when
        they create their account, (Brimstone, Sova, Sage, Phoenix and Jett) and
        will have to unlock the rest of the agents by collecting an in-game
        currency called Kingdom Credits. Kingdom Credits can be acquired by
        playing games or completing daily/weekly task. Each remaining agent can
        be bought with Kingdom Credits. Kingdom credits can also be used to buy
        cosmetic items from each agents contracts.
